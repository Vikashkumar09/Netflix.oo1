Cleaned and Preprocessed the data: I handled missing values, formatted date_added, standardized text, and replaced inconsistent country names.

Exploratory Analysis: I had analyzed key fields like type, director, country, release_year, rating, duration, and listed_in.

Visualizations: I created clear and diverse plots to visualize the distributions and top values across different categories.
